# Cracking The Resume [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/CSE_442/Cracking_the_resume)

A web application where users can upload their resumes and have it reviewed by other users (specific to CS majors). Users also have the ability to upvote, downvote, and comment on other users’ resumes. 

# MVP: 
1) Users will first create a user account with the web application or log into their exisiting account:
  These are the fields they are required to fill out(when they first create an account):
    * Name 
    * Email
    * Major/year 
    * City 
    * What are you looking for? Internship/full-time
2) Then, user uploads their resume to the web app (.pdf files only) 
3) After the user uploads their resume, he/she can upvote, downvote or comment (comments can be upvoted or downvoted) on other users'      resumes.  
4) Users will get notified whenever someone comments/upvote & downvote their resume

# Add-on Features 
  * Making the resume anonymous so users do not see eath other's personal information
  * Meet up with other users (virtually) and practice for interviews 
  * Include other communities/majors 
  * Rank top 10 resumes into top resume page so others can see the best resumes and gain inspiration from them
  * Incorporate a Resume Template Maker that will automatically create a resume for the user once they fill in their information. 
  
# User Story:
I want to have my resume reviewed by other people in my major/field. I also want to be able to look at other people’s resumes and give them valuable feedback in a quick manner. </br>
